## The Challenge

You're building a content generator for your marketing team.

**Questions**:

- What should we include/exclude?
- How do we maintain brand voice?

## Key Metrics for Content

### What Makes Content "5-Star"?

- **Clarity**: Easy to understand
- **Brand Voice**: Consistent with style guide
- **Structure**: Logical flow
- **Engagement**: Compelling and readable
- **Accuracy**: Factually correct

### Common Failure Patterns

Pattern 1: Wrong Tone
- 5-star: Conversational, friendly
- 1-star: Too formal, sounds like textbook

Pattern 2: Missing Examples
- 5-star: Includes concrete examples
- 1-star: Generic advice, no real examples

Pattern 3: Wrong Length
- 5-star: 800-1200 words (substantial)
- 1-star: 200 words (too brief)

Pattern 4: Poor Structure
- 5-star: Clear intro → problem → solution
- 1-star: Rambling, no clear structure

## Iteration Example

**Iteration 1** (65% success):
- Feedback: "Too formal, sounds like Wikipedia"
- Fix: Add "Use casual, conversational tone like talking to friends"

**Iteration 2** (80% success):
- Feedback: "Needs real examples"
- Fix: Add "Include 2-3 concrete examples"

**Iteration 3** (92% success):
- Feedback: "Better! A few posts are still too brief"
- Fix: Add "Posts should be 800-1200 words"

**Final** (96% success): Ready for production

## Tips for Content Evaluation

✅ **Rate based on**:
- Brand voice alignment
- Readability and clarity
- Accuracy of information
- Engagement level
- Usefulness to reader

❌ **Don't rate based on**:
- Personal preference for topic
- Whether you personally would read it
- Length alone (context matters)

## Export for Marketing Team

1. Export golden examples (5-star posts)
2. Extract insights (patterns and recommendations)
3. Share with team:
   - Marketing team uses golden examples as templates
   - Writers reference extracted patterns
   - CI/CD tests new content against standards
