## What is Sageloop?

Sageloop is a behavioral design tool for AI Product Managers. Instead of testing outputs one at a time, **see all your AI outputs at once** and spot patterns instantly.

**The Core Idea**: Rate a batch of AI outputs (20-30), and Sageloop's AI finds the patterns in your ratings to suggest concrete improvements to your prompt.

### Key Benefits

- **Fast evaluation**: Rate 30 outputs in 5 minutes using keyboard shortcuts
- **Pattern discovery**: See failure modes and quality criteria you didn't know you had
- **Actionable insights**: Get specific, copy-pasteable prompt improvements
- **Export for CI/CD**: Ship behavioral specs to your engineering team
