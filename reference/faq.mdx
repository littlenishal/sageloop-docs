Quick answers to common questions about Sageloop.

## Getting Started

### How long does it take to get started?

**15 minutes** from signup to first insights.

You can:
1. Create a project (2 min)
2. Add scenarios (3 min)
3. Generate outputs (2 min)
4. Rate outputs (5 min)
5. Extract patterns (2 min)

### Do I need to know how to code?

**No.** Sageloop is designed for Product Managers. You rate outputs based on your intuition.

No coding, no technical knowledge required.

### How many scenarios do I need?

**Start with 15-30.** This is enough to spot patterns without overwhelming yourself.

If testing narrow behavior (date parsing), 10-15 is okay.
If testing complex behavior, 30-50 is ideal.

## Rating & Feedback

### How do I rate outputs?

Use the 5-star scale:
- **5 stars**: Perfect
- **4 stars**: Good
- **3 stars**: Okay
- **2 stars**: Problem
- **1 star**: Unacceptable

Trust your gut. Rate quickly.

### Do I need to add feedback for every output?

**Only for 1-2 star ratings.** Feedback helps pattern extraction understand root causes.

For 5-star outputs, feedback is optional.

### What if I rate something wrong?

You can edit your rating anytime. Click the pencil icon and change your rating.

### Can I have consistent standards with my team?

Yes. Have the team rate the same outputs independently, then discuss differences. This aligns your standards.

---

## Pattern Extraction

### What's the minimum for extraction?

**15 rated outputs.** You'll get a low-confidence warning with fewer than 15 outputs.

### Why are my patterns low confidence?

**Not enough data.** Add 5-10 more scenarios and rate them. Re-run extraction.

Low confidence means patterns might be noise, not signal.

### What if no patterns are found?

**Possible causes**:
1. All your ratings are 4-5 stars (no failures to cluster)
2. Each failure is unique (no common root cause)
3. Too few ratings (fewer than 15)

**Fix**: Add more scenarios, rate them, and try again.

### Can I trust suggested fixes?

**Usually yes, but verify first.** Review the extraction reasoning before applying fixes.

The AI can hallucinate. Trust your judgment.

## Team & Collaboration (Coming Soon)

### Can I invite teammates?

Yes. Use the Share button in project settings.

Team members can:
- Rate outputs
- Add feedback
- View insights

They have same access as you.

### What if my team disagrees on ratings?

This is actually valuable! It reveals subjective vs. objective quality gaps.

Discuss differences, align on standards, document final definition.

### Who should rate outputs?

**Ideally multiple people**:
- PM (product knowledge)
- Designer (brand/tone)
- Support lead (customer perspective)
- Customer (actual user)

Different perspectives catch issues one person might miss.

## Scenarios

### Can I edit scenarios?

Yes. Click the pencil icon and update the text.

### What if I delete a scenario?

Its outputs and ratings are also deleted.

Be careful. Deleted scenarios can't be recovered.

### Can I import scenarios?

**Yes, three ways**:
1. One at a time (click "Add Scenario")
2. Bulk add (paste multiple, one per line)
3. Import CSV (with `scenario_text` column)

### How do I organize 100+ scenarios?

**Start with 15-30.** Test them, get insights, iterate.

Only add more scenarios when you identify new gaps.

---

## Generation & Models

### Can I regenerate specific scenarios?

Yes. Select scenarios you want, click "Regenerate Selected".

Only those regenerate (saves time).

### How long does generation take?

**30-60 seconds** for 20 scenarios.

Depends on model and API load.

---

## Export

### What can I export?

1. **Golden Examples**: All 5-star outputs (Markdown or JSON)
2. **Test Suite**: Pytest format for CI/CD
3. **Insights**: Extracted patterns and recommendations

### Can I use exports in CI/CD?

Yes. Export as pytest and integrate with your CI pipeline.

Engineers run exported tests to prevent regressions.

### What format is best for sharing?

**For non-technical people**: PDF or Markdown
**For engineers**: JSON or pytest
**For stakeholders**: Summary document + key metrics

---

## Privacy & Security

### Is my data private?

Yes. Projects are private by default.

Only people you explicitly invite can see them.

### Can I delete a project?

Yes, in project settings. Deletion is permanent.

### Do you train on my data?

No. Your data is used only for your project.

---

## Billing & Accounts

### How do I change my plan?

Go to Billing. Choose new plan. Changes take effect immediately.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Generation is failing

Wait a few minutes and retry. Check that you have scenarios added.

### Extraction is showing wrong patterns

Patterns might not be accurate if:
1. Ratings are inconsistent
2. Sample size is too small
3. Each failure is unique

Add more scenarios or review your ratings for consistency.

### My success rate isn't improving after fixes

The fix might not address the root cause.

Try:
1. Making larger prompt changes
2. Being more specific in instructions
3. Adding examples to system prompt
